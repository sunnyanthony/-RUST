I don't know either. I would teach rust randomly. ðŸ˜†

## Python
What we will learn in the python example ?
1. what's `attributes`
    * use attributes of python to change the attributes to python relative
2. basic `class` defination
    * define a class for python to use
3. rust could bind with other programming languages via `ffi`
    * use python as an example
	* the `ffi` was wrapped in `pyo3`
