# RUST
how to learn to be a rust programmer ?    
please refer to [https://doc.rust-lang.org/beta/book/index.html](https://doc.rust-lang.org/beta/book/index.html) to learn by yourself.

## What's here would learn ?
I don't know either. I would teach rust randomly. ðŸ˜†

## Install
* use rustup to install every needs: [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
* install rustfmt to format the code
  * use rustup to install it `rustup component add rustfmt`
* However, I perfer use `brew` to install rust on Mac
  * `brew install rustup`
  * `brew install rustfmt`

## Python
What we will learn in the python example ?
1. what's `attributes`
    * use attributes of python to change the attributes to python relative
2. basic `class` defination
    * define a class for python to use
3. rust could bind with other programming languages via `ffi`
    * use python as an example
	* the `ffi` was wrapped in `pyo3`
